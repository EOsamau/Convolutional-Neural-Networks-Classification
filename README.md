### ABOUT FILES

- CNNModelBuild.ipynb file has the initial model experimentation and training phase to find the optimal CNN architecture and regularization for this classification
- The CNNModelTrain.py file is the script on the model build that saves and stores the model weight and architecture as model.pt
- model.pt contains the trained weights and architecture of the model
- MyTest.py is a script that does not train the model but uses model.pt to evaluate a random test set for accuracy to ensure that the model actually works
